This game was developed for the [JS13KGames Compo 2020 Edition](http://js13kgames.com/) for the Desktop category.

La Once is a little interactive story of a grandkid called Rata and their grandma Patata. Rata visits Patata for la once and helps her with the preparations.

La Once is a Chilean custom were you gather with your love ones, during the afternoon, and have a cup of tea with something tasty to eat.

I recommend playing this game with an XBox controller if possible, but it's available with keyboard.
The controls are:
movement: directional keys or gamepad left axis
run: shift or A button
camera up: s or LT
camera down: d or RT

The whole game was developed from scratch in JavaScript and uses WebGL for rendering.

The sound effects are possible by the awesome library [ZzFX](https://killedbyapixel.github.io/ZzFX/) made by [Frank Force](http://www.frankforce.com/).

I used [Closure Compiler](https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler) to minifiy the JavaScript build.

I also used the impressive compressor [RegPack](https://github.com/Siorki/RegPack) as a final pass to reduce even more the size.

The final build size is:

12.7 KiB (13064 bytes) Zipped

28.4 KiB (29104 bytes) Unzipped
